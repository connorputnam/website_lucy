# a summary about you
summary: 'As a Senior UX Researcher with over 6 years of experience, I balance quantitative and qualitative research methodologies
to investigate and enhance product usability. Whether B2B or B2C, I try to engage non-researchers in my process to show
how the right research approach can transform a worn user experience into something fluid and seamless. My expertise in
various tools enables my team and me to conduct stable, functional studies that deliver reliable results.'
