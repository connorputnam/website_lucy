  #repo: https://github.com/connorputnam/UK-2019-Election-Model # If your project is a public repo on GitHub, then provide this link. it will show star count.

  summary: Since 2023, I’ve led end-to-end UX research for Alteryx Copilot. My work has spanned usability benchmarking using traditional and custom metrics, pricing and packaging research with enterprise buyers, and a retroactive analysis of commonly posted user  questions to identify high-priority support topics and inform AI response design. I’ve supported the product through all phases, past, present, and future —identifying adoption barriers, optimizing usability, and continuously guiding strategy through targeted research at every turn.

  #repo: https://github.com/connorputnam/UK-2019-Election-Model # If your project is a public repo on GitHub, then provide this link. it will show star count.
  #url: "https://www.alteryx.com/products/capabilities/generative-ai/alteryx-copilot"  # If your project is not a public repo but it has a website or any external details url then provide it here. don't provide "repo" and "url" simultaneously.
  summary: I led a research effort focused on deeply understanding the evolving AI expectations of data scientists. Through in-depth interviews, co-design activities, and collaborative journey mapping, I synthesized cross-industry insights that surfaced unmet needs and high-friction moments. The findings directly shaped product and positioning strategy, identifying opportunities for more intelligent tooling, AI support, and better alignment with technical users’ real-world challenges.

  summary: The Soli chip is a miniature radar sensor developed by Google. It was first introduced to consumers in the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL smartphones. Soli emits electromagnetic waves and analyzes how they bounce back off your hand. Using machine learning models, the chip interprets this motion data as specific gestures.Utilizing a delicate hardware prototype in real-world user tests, I conducted research to shape a novel interaction paradigm grounded in human behavior—demonstrating an augmented reality user experience that feels intuitive and magical.

  summary: As the AI champion for the UX research team, I lead efforts to integrate AI tools that boost efficiency and innovation. I created a custom peer review assistant—Research Review Buddy—to support researchers in planning and analysis. I'm continuously vetting AI-moderated research vendors, evaluating tools for GDPR and SOC 2 compliance, and exploring real-world use cases through hands-on demos to assess participant reaction to non-human moderators.
